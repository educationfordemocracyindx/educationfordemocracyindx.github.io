We compiled all the data on indicators, subindexes and the overall EfDI in an excel datafile, which users can download here [link].

We also note that some of the data, particularly for federal states, pertains to the regional rather than national level. This applies to the regions of England (United Kingdom), Flanders (Belgium), Hong Kong and Taiwan (China), and North Rhine-Westphalia and Schleswig-Holstein (Germany). We treated these regions as separate countries. As a result, data on national policies, such as the period of compulsory education or whether citizenship education is included in the lower secondary curriculum, applies to these regions rather than the countries to which they belong.
