The overall EfDI of 2009, 2016 and 2022 is based on 24 indicators covering the seven educational areas explained above. The selection of indicators for the EfDI was guided by conceptual relevance, reliability, consistency, and data availability, and coverage. Indicators were assigned to one of the seven areas based primarily on conceptual relevance. Indicators drawn from the ICCS student, teacher and school principal surveys represent national aggregates of individual-level data. Below we explain the aggregation process.

The indicators [link] document offers a detailed overview of the indicators and the educational areas they represent. This document also explains how the indicators were calculated and combined into the policy and practice sub-indexes for each area and how these subindexes, in turn, were merged into area subindexes. The indicators are further marked with different colours to show whether they are included in both the Levels and Equality subindexes or only in one of them.
