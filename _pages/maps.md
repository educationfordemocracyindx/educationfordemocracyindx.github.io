This option allows you to quickly assess how countries are scoring relative to one another on the main EfDI index, its subindexes, and individual indicators. You can create maps for three points in time and at different levels of granularity.

The main EfDI index is at the highest level of abstraction, while individual indicators provide the most detailed insight into specific policies and practices. Please note that the individual indicator scores are the original, unstandardized values to facilitate interpretation, whereas all subindex and main index scores are based on standardized indicator scores. (See [methodology](https://educationfordemocracyindx.github.io/components/) for details on the standardization procedure.) We have ensured that standardization allows for comparison of main index and subindex scores over time.

#### Maps can be created for the following levels, in ascending order of granularity:

1. The main EfDI index  
2. The subindexes of EfDI Non-System, EfDI Policy, EfDI Practice, EfDI Levels, and EfDI Equality  
3. EfDI subindexes for each of the seven educational areas  
4. An EfDI Policy and an EfDI Practice subindex for each of the seven areas  
5. Individual indicators  

Once you select an index, all other levels will synchronize and only show maps for that index. To view different levels of an index and its related maps select that index and it will synchronize accordingly.
