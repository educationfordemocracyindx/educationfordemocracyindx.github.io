The EfDI consists of national level data on system characteristics and educational policies and practices that have been found in the literature to promote democratic competences and/or to diminish inequality in such competences. Higher scores on the main index or its sub-indexes mean that a country’s policies and practices do a relatively good job in promoting these outcomes – i.e. increasing both levels of and equality in democratic competences. The EfDI and its subindexes are multidimensional. They comprise a set of indicators covering seven educational areas that are important for the formation of democratic competences. To build the EfDI conceptually, we started by drawing on the Reference-Framework-of-Competences-for-Democratic-Culture (RFCDC) [link] of the Council of Europe (CoE) to identify these competences (i.e. the values, attitudes, skills, knowledge and behaviours that support democracy). Examples of such competences include freedom of speech, respect for difference, respecting the rule of law, political participation, knowledge about the political system and the skills to navigate it, and a belief that all citizens are equal in status and need to be treated equally. Next, we conducted an extensive review [link]* of the scholarly literature on all the areas of education influencing these competences. This resulted in the identification of seven areas of education having the following distinct effects on democratic competences:

| Educational area | Effect on democratic competences |
| :----------- | :------------: |
| Citizenship education (CE) curriculum       |    The more clearly CE has been defined in the national curriculum, the more topics CE covers and the more time is devoted to CE in the school curriculum, the higher the level of and the greater the equality in democratic competences    |
| Participatory pedagogy      |    The more the teaching in schools allows students to practice democracy by allowing them to discuss social issue freely and by giving them a voice in their learning, the higher the level of and the greater the equality in democratic competences    |
| CE in teacher training       |    The more comprehensively CE is addressed in teacher training, the higher the level of and the greater the equality in democratic competences    |
