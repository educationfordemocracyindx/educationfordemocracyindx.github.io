Three existing data sources were used to find good indicators for the seven areas. The data source providing the bulk of the indicators is the [International Civic and Citizenship Education Study](https://www.iea.nl/studies/iea/iccs) (ICCS). This comprehensive study includes survey data on citizenship education and civic attitudes from students (13-15 year olds), teachers, school principals and education officials. It covers many European and several non-European countries and has been conducted in 2009, 2016 and 2022. We used data from the student, teacher and principal surveys to find indicators for the practice components and drew on the survey among education officials (the national context survey) to find indicators for the policy components of as many as six of the seven areas (CE curriculum; Participatory pedagogy; CE in teacher training; School ethos; Unitary system of education, length of compulsory education).

We sourced indicators for common education (both the policy and practice component) from the OECD [Programme for International Student Assessment](https://www.oecd.org/en/about/programmes/pisa.html) (PISA) studies, more particularly from the reports of the 2009, 2015 and 2022 editions of the study. PISA offers a comprehensive test of the skills and knowledge of 15-year-old students in mathematics, reading and science along with information on the institutional characteristics of education systems. Starting in OECD countries it has gradually expanded to include 81 countries in the 2022 edition of the study. It has run every three years from 2000.
