The project is funded by a Research Project Grant from the Leverhulme Trust
for a period of four years until January 2028. Apart from developing the EfDI, the project
aims to relate the EfDI to national political and cultural traditions to see how path-dependent
the policies and practices that it captures are. It further seeks to relate the EfDI
(including its sub-indexes, fields and indicators) to young peopleâ€™s democratic competences
to assess whether these policies and practices are likely to contribute to positive outcomes.
